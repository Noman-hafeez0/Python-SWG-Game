Twinkle, #####, little star, how I wonder what you are. Up above the world so high,
like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, #####, little star, how I wonder what you are.
When the blazing sun is set, and the grass with dew is wet. Then you show your little
light, #####, ##### all the night. Twinkle, ##### little star, how I wonder what you
are.
Then the traveler in the dark thanks you for your tiny spark. How could he see where to
go if you did not ##### so? Twinkle, ##### little star, how I wonder what you are.
As your bright and tiny spark lights the traveler in the dark, though I know not what you
are, #####, #####, little star. Twinkle, #####, little star, how I wonder what you are.
